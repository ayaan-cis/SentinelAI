## Cybersecurity Intelligence, Amplified

SentinelAI is a cutting-edge, AI-driven network intrusion detection system that leverages multiple machine learning algorithms to identify malicious network activities in real-time. Using advanced anomaly detection techniques and explainable AI, SentinelAI not only detects potential threats but provides security analysts with clear, actionable insights into why activities were flagged.

## üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Security Features

- **Multi-model AI Detection Engine**: Combines Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and DBSCAN algorithms in an ensemble approach for superior threat detection
- **Neural Feature Engineering**: Automatically extracts and analyzes over 20 network flow characteristics using neural-inspired feature extraction
- **Zero-Day Threat Detection**: Identifies previously unknown attack patterns through behavioral analysis and unsupervised learning
- **Explainable Security Intelligence**: Provides human-readable insights into detection decisions, enabling rapid incident response
- **Real-time Cyber Threat Monitoring**: Processes and analyzes network flows as they happen with millisecond response times

## üîç Attack Vectors Detected

SentinelAI's neural networks and machine learning algorithms are trained to detect sophisticated attack patterns including:

| Attack Type | Description | Detection Method |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Port Scanning** | Reconnaissance attacks probing network services | Temporal pattern analysis + protocol anomaly detection |
| **Brute Force** | Credential attacks against authentication systems | Rate limiting anomalies + destination profiling |
| **Data Exfiltration** | Unauthorized data transfers | Volumetric anomaly detection + destination analysis |
| **Denial of Service** | Resource exhaustion attacks | Statistical outlier detection + protocol analysis |

## üß† AI Technology Stack

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Detects anomalies without requiring labeled training data
- **Semi-supervised Learning**: Leverages known patterns to improve detection accuracy
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple ML models for higher accuracy and lower false positives
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identifies which network characteristics contributed most to detection
- **Neural-inspired Anomaly Scoring**: Quantifies the severity of detected anomalies
